# Sorting Robot

The sorting robot consists of two Panda robot arms.
It sorts objects based on their colors to matching baskets.
This may involve:
- grasping and dropping of objects
- handovers between the robot arms if a basket is not reachable for one arm
- throwing of objects if both arms cannot reach the basket

The robot can handle balls and capsules as objects.
